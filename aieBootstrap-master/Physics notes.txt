Research this
	sphere plane etc
	algebra formulas to change to find certain kinematic variables such as acceleration
	instead of finding only velocity or displacement



Delta time is the time inbetween each frame

fixed timestep 
	totaltime += deltatime
	if (totaltime > fixedtimestep)
	{
		do physics
		totaltime - fixedtimestep
	}

temporal aliasing
	if the amount of render frames is higher than physics frames jittering can occur
	to combat this, interpolate inbetween the previous physics result and the current one
	current pos = lerp(previous,current, accumulated time/fixed timestep)

kinematics is the study of movement with no forces applied to it (baseball at 10kmh over time)
dynamics is the study of movement with forces applied (baseball at 10kmh + gravity + wind resistance)

World = particles for everything (human cells etc)
Rigidbody is summarised into one particle
most rigidbodies will have
	position
	velocity (direction of movement over time)
	acceleration (how the velocity changes over time)
	mass (not weight directly but mass is the size with no forces, eg if same object on moon the weight is different to earth because of gravity but mass is the same
	momentum = mass * velocity
	force (change in momentum over time)

Newtons laws
	1 object will be at rest unless acted apon by a force and it will not stop moving until a force stops it
	2 force = acceleration / mass.          acceleration = force/mass.         
	3 every action has an equal and opposite reaction


Collision detection
	unit normal is the 90 degree from the face of the object and is of length 1


Kinematic formulas
	^x triangle but yeah = displacement which is an objects change in position
	^t = change in position over time
	v0 = inital velocity
	v = final velocity
	a = constant acceleration

	knowing 3 or more of the kinematic variables allows to solve for one of the unknown ones


Formulas ^

final velocity = 
	inital velocity + accleration * time

displacement = 
	(final velocity + inital velocity) / 2 * time

displacement can also be = 
	inital velocity * time + (0.5 * accleration * (time^2))


for these formulas to work 
	acceleration has to be constant
	time interval is a known value (usually shown in seconds)
	variables keep direction (x = horiz, y = vertical)


Projectile motion

	for a explanition lets assume a gun example
	large force to start and only gravity affecting the bullet that has left
	
	compound motion
	each axis of motion is independent from each other
	so horizontal doesnt affect vertical
	this requries us to write a formula for each axis of motion
	(gravity wont affect horizontal movement eg x movespeed
	
	x = inital force horizontal
	y = inital force vertical and gravity
